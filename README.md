The Moviechecker utility is a small java programm that tries to help you with your movies. It uses ffprobe and ffmpeg to do this. It provides two different modes, scan and convert.

In the scan mode it will check a given directory with ffprobe and store the results in a XML database file. 

In the convert mode it will convert a number of files with the matching video encoding with ffmpeg.


## Please see this version of the tool as a initial version that is not ready for "productive" use.
